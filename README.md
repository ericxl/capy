        def decrement(self):
            self.number -= 1
        def increment(self):
             self.number += 1

    def body(self):
        return ca.VStack(
            ca.Heading(f'Count: {self.state.number} '),
            ca.HStack(
                ca.Button("lower", bg='red', on_click=self.State.decrement),
