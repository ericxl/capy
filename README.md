class IndexView:
  @StateObject
  class State:
    selected_image = None
    image_processed = (False, None)

  def applePayPressed(self):
    # handle payment
    pass

  def body(self):
    return VStack(
      ConditionalView(
        self.State.image_processed[0],
        true_view=VStack(
          Image(self.State.selected_image)
            .frame(300, 300)
            .corner_radius(20),
          Text(self.State.image_processed[1])),
        false_view=FilePicker(type=PHOTOS, 
                              selected_item = self.State.selected_image)),
