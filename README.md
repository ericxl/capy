Let's creat an image caption generator that accept an image upload:

&nbsp;

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/demo.gif" width="550" />
</div>

&nbsp;

This is all done in one Python file in a Flask project and stop writing templates.

```python
from flask import Flask
from capy import Capy

app = Flask(__name__)

class IndexView:
  @StateObject
  class State:
    selected_image = None
    image_processed = (False, None)

  def applePayPressed(self):
    # handle payment
    pass

  def body(self):
    return VStack(
      ConditionalView(
        self.State.image_processed[0],
        true_view=VStack(
          Image(self.State.selected_image)
            .frame(300, 300)
            .corner_radius(20),
          Text(self.State.image_processed[1])),
        false_view=FilePicker(type=PHOTOS, 
                              selected_item = self.State.selected_image)),
      ApplePayButton(on_click=self.applePayPressed))

# the minimal Flask app
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return IndexView()
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=81)

```

BTW, did I tell you Capy also supports mobile and desktop apps? YES! And it isn't not a web port: it translate to mobile native UI components so it feels like mobile!
